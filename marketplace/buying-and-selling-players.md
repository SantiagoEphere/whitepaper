# Buying & selling players

To play Ephere, you'll need a squad of —at least— 11 players. There are multiple ways of acquiring them. One is to buy them from other people. As players are provided as NFT, you can buy/sell/give/transfer them anytime you want, in the NFT market of your preference.

To provide a better experience when doing so, we'll provide our own marketplace which will offer some advantages:

* Players transferred in Ephere's marketplace will preserve their improvements (Experience or trained skills, for example).
* It'll have a more powerful search engine, tailored for Ephere's game.
