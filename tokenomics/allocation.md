### Advisors <a href="#13df" id="13df"></a>

Just like any enterprise, Ephere needs the counsel and guidance of more experienced people —their time invested in helping us meet our potential is rewarded with [$EPH](usdeph.md). These tokens represent 3% of the total supply and will be locked for 1 year after TGE. Those who decide to join us in this capacity are big believers in how our economy will work: people with a vested interest in the sustained growth of this model, sporting with a win-win mentality.

### Core Team <a href="#5e49" id="5e49"></a>

The core team will take only 2% of the total token supply. These tokens are locked for 1 year. We're commited to build a sunstainable game economy that will last many many years.

### Marketing

6% of the total token supply will go for Marketing campaigns. 20% of these will be unlocked after TGE, and the rest will be unlocked by 10% on a monthly-basis.

### Private Sale <a href="#9119" id="9119"></a>

Are you among the brave? The bold? The early believers? Ephereals who meet this criteria can currently partake in our private token sale at a huge _**20% discount**_. These tokens represent 1% of the total supply and will be unlocked after TGE.

### Public Sale <a href="#e0ef" id="e0ef"></a>

This is a big one: our public token offering will go live in February 2022. These tokens represent 16% of the total supply. 40% of these tokens will be unlocked after TGE, and the rest will be unlocked by 20% on a monthly-basis.

The funds raised through this offering will be allocated as follows:

### Play to Earn <a href="#3875" id="3875"></a>

_Play-to-earn is at our core_. We wish for Ephereals to reap the most benefit out of the token. It’ll be widely used in gameplay and it’ll be the reward they get for doing what they love: _playing_. It’s only fair that the base of our economy benefits our users. These tokens represent 40% of the total supply and will be smartly and automatically minted by Ephere itself by rewarding specific behaviors such as:

* Winning competitions
* Using the Ephere marketplace
* Providing NFT and [$EPH](usdeph.md) liquidity (staking them)
* And many more still to come (as we’re always thinking of innovative and fair behaviors that can yield gains to all Ephereals.)

### Reserve <a href="#4d55" id="4d55"></a>

20% of the total supply will remain unminted unless it’s absolutely necessary. The idea of this reserve is to have enough token liquidity to cope with any unforeseen situations. Keeping $EPH valuable is truly important for everyone!
