### Advisors & Marketing <a href="#13df" id="13df"></a>

Just like any enterprise, Ephere needs the counsel and guidance of more experienced people —their time invested in helping us meet our potential is rewarded with [$EPH](usdeph.md). These tokens represent 6% of the total supply and are already minted and unlocked. Those who decide to join us in this capacity are big believers in how our economy will work: people with a vested interest in the sustained growth of this model, sporting with a win-win mentality.

### Core Team <a href="#5e49" id="5e49"></a>

We believe and support those who create Ephere, thus founders should stay incentivized after a successful bootstrapping. The 20% of the total token supply assigned to the core team will be unlocked gradually over a period of 480 days.

### Play to Earn <a href="#3875" id="3875"></a>

_Play-to-earn is at our core_. We wish for Ephereals to reap the most benefit out of the token. It’ll be widely used in gameplay and it’ll be the reward they get for doing what they love: _playing_. It’s only fair that the base of our economy benefits our users. These tokens represent 40% of the total supply and will be smartly and automatically minted by Ephere itself by rewarding specific behaviors such as:

* Winning competitions
* Using the Ephere marketplace
* Providing NFT and [$EPH](usdeph.md) liquidity (staking them)
* And many more still to come (as we’re always thinking of innovative and fair behaviors that can yield gains to all Ephereals.)

### Public Sale <a href="#e0ef" id="e0ef"></a>

This is a big one: our public token offering will go live in February 2022.

### Private Sale <a href="#9119" id="9119"></a>

Are you among the brave? The bold? The early believers? Ephereals who meet this criteria can currently partake in our private token sale at a huge 1_**0% discount**_. You can contact our Growth team for more information: [Héctor](mailto:tico@ephere.football) will take good care of you!

### Reserve <a href="#4d55" id="4d55"></a>

20% of the total supply will remain unminted unless it’s absolutely necessary. The idea of this reserve is to have enough token liquidity to cope with any unforeseen situations. Keeping $EPH valuable is truly important for everyone!
