| ![](../.gitbook/assets/Hector.png)     | Héctor is in charge of growth for this amazing universe. He has been a technologist since he can remember. He became hooked on video games since the first time his elder cousins let him join them in days-long Mario Bros sessions over the holidays. He once sold a pair of Jordan sneakers so that he could afford an SNES system!                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Keli (1).png>) | Keli is the Ephere's Community Manager. She will be leading our Discord staff, and managing social media. She always wanted to be a rocket engineer, and actually she kinda is, because she believe Ephere is a rocket that will fly very, very high. And she is putting all her efforts to make that happen.                                                                                                                                                                               |
