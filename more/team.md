#### Agu

![](../.gitbook/assets/Agu.png)

Iâ€™m Agu, Founder & CEO of Ephere.

I envision a world where people can work doing the thing they love. Thatâ€™s why we are building Ephere, a football game where people can play to earn. Some funâ€™t facts about me: I like stoicism, I can fly planes, I mostly use plain B/W T-Shirts (though Iâ€™m slowly changing my uniform to a more colorful version ![ðŸ˜‰](https://discord.com/assets/2e41bfdeba797283ee9da9bb439c3ece.svg)), and Iâ€™ll go to space someday.

#### HÃ©ctor

Iâ€™m in charge of growth for this amazing universe.

Iâ€™ve been a technologist since I can remember. I became hooked on video games since the first time my elder cousins let me join them in days-long Mario Bros sessions over the holidays. I once sold a pair of Jordan sneakers so that I could afford a SNES system. But for as hard as I tried, I could never become involved in video game development â€” until now.

#### Yazo

Hey, Iâ€™m Felipe, but you can call me Yazo. Iâ€™m Co-founder, Art Director, and Director of Awesomeness at Ephere.

When Iâ€™m not behind my desk crafting Ephereals, Iâ€™m probably out biking, watching Blade Runner for the 92nd time, or trying to communicate with a random cat I just met.

Iâ€™m also a tattoo artist, so hit me up whenever youâ€™re ready to get your Ephereal permanently inked to the side of your face.

#### Keli

Hey! I'm Keli, Ephere's Community Manager Intern. I'll be leading our Discord staff, and managing social media. I always wanted to be a rocket engineer, and actually, I kinda am, because I believe Ephere is a rocket that will fly very, very high. And I will put in all my efforts to make that happen. ![ðŸš€](https://discord.com/assets/748ff0e7b2f1f22adecad8463de25945.svg) If there's anything you need, including playing video games, please hit me up!\

#### Rodri&#x20;

Hi! I'm Rodri and I'm a Software Engineer at Ephere, where I work with a great team crafting some cool stuff.

I'm a huge fan of Boca Juniors and football in general. I live in Buenos Aires and I try to go to the stadium whenever Boca plays at 'La Bombonera'. It's quite an experience.

I'm also a red wine lover, so you can hit me up if you have any recommendations!
