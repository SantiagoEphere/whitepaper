# League

When you sign up as a new user, you will be automatically assigned to a league with free space. Each league consists of 16 teams. If there are no free leagues available anymore, a new league will be created. Leagues follow a hierarchical structure:

Each team plays each other team in the same league twice per season. As there are 16 clubs per league, you play 30 matches per season. League matches are played once a day, so a season will last around a month.

At the end of the season, the 4 teams at the top of each league will be promoted to the next higher league level. Likewise, the weakest 4 teams of each league will be relegated to a league with a level one below the current league. The 4 teams at the top of the league will receive [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) rewards according to their position.
