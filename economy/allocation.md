### Core Team <a href="#5e49" id="5e49"></a>

The core team will take only 2% of the total token supply. These tokens will be locked for 1 year after [TGE](https://decrypt.co/resources/token-generation-events-what-are-they-guide).

### Marketing

6% of the total token supply will go for Marketing campaigns. 20% of these will be unlocked after TGE, and the rest will be unlocked by batches of 20% on each subsequent quarter.

### Liquidity Pool <a href="#e0ef" id="e0ef"></a>

10% of the total supply will be allocated to our Liquidity Pool in PancakeSwap. Locked for 1 year.

### Play to Earn <a href="#3875" id="3875"></a>

_Play-to-Earn is at our core_. We wish for Ephereals to reap the most benefit out of the token. It’ll be widely used in gameplay and it’ll be the reward they get for doing what they love: _playing_. It’s only fair that the base of our economy benefits our users. These tokens represent 62% of the total supply and will be smartly and automatically minted by Ephere itself by rewarding specific behaviors such as:

* Winning competitions.
* Providing NFT and [$EPH](usdeph.md) liquidity (staking them).
* And many more still to come (as we’re always thinking of innovative and fair behaviors that can yield gains to all Ephereals.)
