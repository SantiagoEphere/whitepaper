# Visual appearance

### Visual appearance

We want our users to love their players, but it’s hard to love a faceless dataset. That’s why we crafted detail-rich visuals that complement the data model by giving it a curated visual appearance.

There are two ways of determining the visual appearance of an Ephere Football Player. For most of them it’s by their genetic code, a number in the data model that determines different traits. Each trait corresponds to a different body part. Those parts are then combined to produce the final image. Between the many different traits there are billions of possible combinations.

For some other very rare players (limited editions) the visual appearance will be crafted by our artists.

#### Personalization

For those players with an algorithmically-generated visual appearance, owners will be able to add accessories such as tattoos, piercings, makeup, as well as styling their hair and customizing their kits.

### Inclusiveness

One of the things that distinguishes our project from all others is that our visual traits include several underrepresented groups. Parading this kind of diversity makes us very proud, indeed! We encourage you to help us send a message of inclusion, tolerance, and respect by letting us know if we missed any of them, and also by demanding your game/service providers to include them when representing humans.
