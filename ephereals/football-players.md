# Football players

In Ephere, football players are non-fungible, transferable, and scarce digital assets stored in an Ethereum smart contract implementing the ERC-721 standard (also known as NFT).

They have mental and physical attributes, trainable football skills that are capped by genetic and distinctive visual properties, some of which can be changed by their owner. Players gain experience by playing matches, and they can also get tired, injured, grow old, and retire — _they’re alive_.&#x20;

Males, females, and non-binary genders from all different species (as not all the players are human) can play together.

### Attributes & skills

We want Ephere to be a fun game in which people can express their creativity, ingenuity, and strategic thinking to maximize their chance of success. To accomplish that we need a complex football match simulation engine with the capacity to simulate a wide range of football situations. And that needs a complex football player data model. That’s why our players have a broad set of attributes that describe several aspects of their uniqueness:

### Visual appearance

We want our users to love their players, but it’s hard to love a faceless dataset. That’s why we crafted detail-rich visuals that complement the data model by giving it a curated visual appearance.

There are two ways of determining the visual appearance of an Ephere Football Player. For most of them it’s by their genetic code, a number in the data model that determines different traits. Each trait corresponds to a different body part. Those parts are then combined to produce the final image. Between the many different traits there are billions of possible combinations. For some other very rare players (limited editions) the visual appearance will be crafted by our artists.

For those players with an algorithmically-generated visual appearance, owners will be able to add accessories such as tattoos, piercings, makeup, as well as styling their hair and customizing their kits.

One of the things that distinguishes our project from all others is that our visual traits include several underrepresented groups. Parading this kind of diversity makes us very proud, indeed! We encourage you to help us send a message of inclusion, tolerance, and respect by letting us know if we missed any of them, and also by demanding your game/service providers to include them when representing humans.
