# Introduction

![Game central screen](<../.gitbook/assets/Central Screen WIP2.png>)

The game revolves around managing your own football team which includes hiring football players, setting the team's lineup, in-match strategy, and managing its infrastructure (training facilities, stadium, etc) to maximize your chances of winning matches, competitions, and completing challenges and earn [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) cryptocurrency along the way.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike football fantasy games based on blockchain technology, Ephere is built around a complex football simulation engine that allows users to express their creativity, ingenuity, and strategic thinking to maximize their chance of success. Unlike other football management simulation games (with complex football simulation engines), Ephere is a blockchain-based decentralized application built around a play-to-earn economy.

* [PvP](pvp-match.md): your team plays against another user's team with similar OVR
* [League](league.md): your team recurrently plays matches in a hierarchical league
