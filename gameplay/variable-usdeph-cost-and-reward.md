# Variable $EPH cost & reward

To provide a stable and predictable gameplay cost & reward, Ephere's economy is balanced around a set dollar value. That means that in-game [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) costs and rewards will be adjusted based on the USD price of 1 [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) token, ensuring that the USD value of the costs and rewards stays the same for all users at any moment in time.

The reason behind this decision is that, as the [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) max supply is fixed, the USD price of the token will tend to go up as the game is more demanded, which will incentivize people to move [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) out of Ephere's economy, leading to very high gameplay costs.&#x20;

By utilizing this balancing mechanism we form a correlation between active users and the dollar value of [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md), protecting users from wild fluctuations in the market price, and maintaining for extended --and sustainable-- periods of time the costs and rewards of the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) costs and rewards specified in the Gameplay and Marketplace sections of this Whitepaper will be expressed as the approximate USD value of the [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) cost or reward.
