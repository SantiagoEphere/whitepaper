# Variable $EPH cost & reward

To provide a stable and predictable gameplay cost & reward, Ephere's economy is balanced around a set dollar value. That means that in-game $EPH costs and rewards will be adjusted based on the USD price of 1 $EPH token, ensuring that the USD value of the costs and rewards stays the same for all users at any moment in time.

The reason behind this decision is that, as the $EPH max supply is fixed, the USD price of the token will tend to go up as the game is more demanded, which will incentivize people to move $EPH out of Ephere's economy, leading to very high gameplay costs.&#x20;

By utilizing this balancing mechanism we form a correlation between active users and the dollar value of $EPH, protecting users from wild fluctuations in the $EPH market price, and maintaining for extended --and sustainable-- periods of time the costs and rewards of the game.
