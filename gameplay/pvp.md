# PvP match

This game mode allows you put your team to play a 11vs11 match against the team of another user. When you submit your squad and tactics you will be added to the match-making queue until another team with similar OVR is available for a PvP match.

To play PvP matches users have to pay [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md). The winner receives \~ USD 1 from the Play To Earn budget plus 99% of the match stake (Ephere takes the remaining 1%). This means that when you win a PvP match you're doubling your [$EPH](../tokenomics/usdeph.md) investment.

You can play up to 2 matches per day, as long as your players have enough energy. Remember that using tired players highly increases the chances of them getting injured.
