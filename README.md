**Ephere **is a football-based gaming universe where people can earn cryptocurrency through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. It consists of two main components; The first one is a scarce collection of carefully designed football players provided as NFTs. On top of it, there's a football-management simulation game that allows people to use these football players in a fun play-to-earn gaming experience.

**Football players** have mental and physical attributes, trainable football skills, and a detail-rich visual appearance. They gain experience by playing matches, and can also get tired, injured, grow old, and retire — _they’re alive_. Males, females, and non-binary genders from all different species (as not all the players are human) can play together.

**The game** revolves around managing your own football team which includes hiring players (NFTs), setting the team's lineup, in-match strategy, and managing its infrastructure (training facilities, stadium, etc). Your team can win $EPH cryptocurrency by winning matches, competitions, and completing challenges.&#x20;
