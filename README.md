## Intro

**Ephere** is a football-based gaming metaverse where people can earn cryptocurrency through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. It consists of two main components; The first one is a scarce collection of carefully designed football players provided as NFTs. On top of it, there's a football-management simulation game that allows people to use these football players in a fun play-to-earn gaming experience.

**Football players** are at the very core of the universe. We call them **Ephereals**, due to their ethereal yet realistic nature. They have mental and physical attributes, trainable football skills, and a detail-rich visual appearance. They gain experience by playing matches, and can also get tired, injured, grow old, and retire — _they’re alive_.

**The game** revolves around managing your own football team which includes hiring players (NFTs), setting the team's lineup, in-match strategy, and managing its infrastructure (training facilities, stadium, etc) to maximize your chances of winning matches, competitions, completing challenges, and earn $EPH cryptocurrency along the way.
